# FlappyDisk

This is a application that used the MIPS to create an game simialr to the popular game, Flappy Bird. 

Steps to play the game. 
1. in order to run the code for this repositry you must have downlaod MARS through this link: https://courses.missouristate.edu/kenvollmar/mars/download.htm
2. This application is an MARS MIPS simulator. When the porgram is dowloaded. click on the file and a application will open through Java. 
3. After that you are able to complie and run this program. 

Instructions on how to run the program
First assemble the code by clicking the assemble button on the toolbar. Then open
the Bitmap Display  and the Keyboard and Display MMIO simulator. For the Bitmap set the pixel width and height to 4. Also set the display height and width to 256. Lastly set the base address to 0X10008000 ($gp). Furthermore, place two windows in a way that both are accessible. Now, connect the Bitmap display to MIPS by clicking the Connect to MIPS button. Then,click the run button in the toolbar. At this point you should see two columns and a disk in the background and a logo that spells Flappy Disk. To start the game type any key in the  Keyboard simulator expect Q. At this point the game will start and the disk will begin to fall, to keep the disk pressing the spacebar.
